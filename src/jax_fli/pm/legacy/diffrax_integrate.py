    Unified ODE integration with adjoint selection.

    This function provides a unified interface to ODE integration, allowing

    Parameters
    ----------
    terms : tuple[ODETerm, ...]
        A tuple of ODETerm instances that describe the system dynamics.
    solver : AbstractSolver
        A diffrax AbstractSolver instance specifying the integration method.
    t0 : float
        The starting time for integration.
    t1 : float
        The ending time for integration.
    dt0 : float
        The step size for each integration increment.
    y0 : Any
        The initial state of the system (scalar, array, or PyTree).
    args : Any, optional
        Additional parameters for the ODE system (any PyTree).
    saveat : SaveAt, optional
        A diffrax SaveAt object specifying when and how to save solution snapshots.
        Defaults to saving at the final time.
    adjoint : Union[str, AbstractAdjoint], optional
        Either "reverse" (string) for custom reverse-mode VJP implementation,
        or a diffrax AbstractAdjoint instance for diffeqsolve.
        Defaults to "reverse".

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        The computed solution snapshots at the times specified by the saveat configuration.

    Notes
    -----
    When adjoint="reverse", uses a custom implementation that exploits the
    reversibility of symplectic integrators for memory-efficient gradient
    computation. This avoids storing the full forward trajectory.

    When adjoint is a diffrax AbstractAdjoint (e.g., RecursiveCheckpointAdjoint,
    BacksolveAdjoint), delegates to diffeqsolve with that adjoint method.

    Integrates an ODE system using a scanning approach with uniform time steps and extracts snapshots
    at specified times.

    This "vanilla" integrator advances the solution from t0 to t1 in fixed increments of dt0,
    storing the full state at each step. The final snapshots are then extracted at times defined by
    the saveat configuration. This method is particularly useful for debugging or comparison with the
    main integrator, though it may consume significant memory for fine-grained or long-duration integrations.

    Args:
        y0: The initial state of the system.
        args: Parameters for the ODE system.
        terms: A tuple of ODETerm instances defining the system's dynamics.
        solver: The solver instance providing the .step method for integration.
        t0: The initial time for integration.
        t1: The final time for integration.
        dt0: The fixed step size for the forward integration.
        saveat: (Optional) A SaveAt object specifying the times at which to save snapshots.

    Returns:
        A PyTree containing the solution snapshots at the times specified in the saveat configuration.
